I had spent a lot more money than I should have on presents since I rarely see him.  In any case, he handed out the gifts in such a way to make it look like he and his girlfriend gave us more gifts than they did.  He handed out mine at first and frontloaded them to ""get them out of the way"" and saved their gifts for last.  It was a shell game and it was disrespectful to think that I wouldn't notice it.  The few gifts ""they"" did give were all picked out and purchased by his girlfriend.  It was as if he was above shopping himself so he outsourced it.  What a joke.  It was an insult to my intelligence to think I wouldn't notice.  His initials are BJ.","very much","not at all","6","very much","6","very much","very much","6","6","very much","6","4","2","6","2","6","Male","45","Some college, but no degree (yet)","Somewhat conservative","66285"
